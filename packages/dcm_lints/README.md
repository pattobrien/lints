Lints based on ```package:dart_code_metrics```, re-implemented for [Sidecar](https://pub.dev/packages/sidecar).

> NOTE: The package was created as a means of benchmarking Sidecar against ```package:analyzer_plugin```, which both Sidecar and Dart Code Metrics currently use to run in the IDE. If you wish to use these lints to aid your app development, continue to use the official [dart_code_metrics](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_code_metrics) package. Credit for the content of these rules goes entirely to Dmitry Zhifarsky and the DCM team.

## Included Lints

- no_equal_then_else

## Next Steps

Only a few lints from ```package:dart_code_metrics``` are included so far. Once the Sidecar API has been mostly locked down, more lints may be implemented as a means of benchmarking and/or stress-testing the Sidecar system. If you want to track progress of the Sidecar ecosystem as a whole, you can subscribe to notifications via the Sidecar github repo.
