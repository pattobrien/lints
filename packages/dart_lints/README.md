Official lints based on the Dart Style Guide, re-implemented for [Sidecar](https://pub.dev/packages/sidecar).

The package was created as a means of benchmarking Sidecar against the official Linter package included with the Dart SDK.

## Included Lints

- always_declare_return_types
- always_put_control_body_on_new_line
- always_put_required_named_parameters_first
- always_require_non_null_named_parameters
- always_specify_types

## Next Steps

Only a few links are included so far; once the Sidecar API has been locked down, more lints will be implemented as means to stress-test the Sidecar system. To track progress, you can subscribe to notifications via the Sidecar github repo.
